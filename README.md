# THE FINAL CUT üé¨

Welcome to THE FINAL CUT, our movie review website where you can save movies you want to watch, write reviews about any movie you've watched and share your honest opinions, but also read other users¬¥ reviews.

## WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT ‚≠êÔ∏è

This website is made to suit anyone, regardless of who you are, how old you are, or what you like. It has a clean layout and simple navigation. No clutter or information overload. Just a nice and fun movie review page!

### WATCH A MOVIE AND WRITE A REVIEW üëÄ

Since this is a movie review website, you can of course create your own honest reviews and share them with others. Just watch any movie you like, then head to the website, enter the title, rate it with as many stars as you want, and share your thoughts!

Changed your mind?
No problem!
You can easily remove your review by clicking the trashcan on the review.

### ADD ANY MOVIE TO YOUR WATCHLIST ‚ù§Ô∏è

On every detail page on our website, you will find a little heart under the description. Simply press that heart, and it will turn red ‚ù§Ô∏è - this means that it has been added to your watchlist.

Finished watching or changed your mind? No problem! Just like reviews, you can remove movies from your watchlist anytime.

### TAKE AND GIVE INSPIRATION ü§ùüèΩ

THE FINAL CUT is made for both reading and writing reviews, so do both! Check out what other people think. Maybe you¬¥ll agree, maybe you won¬¥t. The only way to find out is to share your thoughts and opinions...
