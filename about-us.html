          At The Final Cut, we're three students from Jönköping University
          studying graphic design and web development. As movie lovers, we often
          found it frustrating to scroll through cluttered movie websites,
          unsure of what to watch next. So, we decided to create our own
          platform — one that makes discovering and sharing great films simple
          and enjoyable.

          On The Final Cut, users can review movies, rate them, and give
          recommendations to others. We've also added a watchlist feature, so
          you can easily save movies you want to see — or revisit the ones you
          loved. Our goal is to build a clean, community-driven space for movie
          fans to connect and help each other find their next favorite film.
